# Preview view harness

A lightweight "Compose Preview" for the VS Code panel itself. Renders the
real `<preview-app>` Lit element in headless Chromium, driven by fixture
JSON, and writes a PNG per `(fixture × theme)` pair. Use it to iterate on
panel design — accessibility extension layouts, focus mode chrome, error
states — without rebuilding the extension and reattaching to a host.

## Agent workflow

If you're an AI agent editing anything under `src/webview/`,
`media/preview.css`, `media/preview-*.svg`, or any other file that
affects what the panel looks like: render a baseline + post-change
snapshot via this harness and surface both PNGs to the user before
claiming the task is done. Production UI changes without a visual
record are not done.

The loop is:

1. **Pick a fixture** that exercises the surface you're touching. Check
   `fixtures/` first — `grid-default` covers the multi-card grid;
   `a11y-findings` covers focus mode + the Accessibility bundle (chip
   bar, data tab, on-image overlay). If neither hits your surface,
   write a new fixture (`<surface>.gen.mjs` + emitted `.json`) and
   commit it alongside the production change. A fixture is small and
   future-proof — they're the design contract for the panel.

2. **Baseline.** Before editing source:

    ```sh
    HARNESS_FIXTURE=<name> npm --prefix vscode-extension run harness:snapshot
    ```

    Copy the PNG out of `preview-harness/out/` so the re-snapshot
    doesn't clobber it (e.g. `cp out/<name>.dark.png /tmp/before.png`).
    Skip the baseline only when you know the file is brand new with no
    "before" — say so explicitly in your reply instead of silently
    skipping.

3. **Make the change.**

4. **Re-snapshot.** Same command. The bundle rebuild is wired into the
   npm script.

5. **Diff and surface.** Send the user both PNGs (baseline + after) via
   `SendUserFile` with a short caption pointing at what changed. The
   user signs off on the visual, not on prose claims about it.

A few specifics that come up:

- `imageData` in `updateImage` messages is **raw base64** — the card
  prepends `data:<mime>;base64,` itself. Half the cards rendering
  blank is almost always this.
- New `--vscode-*` tokens in `media/preview.css` need values in
  `vscode-theme.css` (both `:root` and `[data-vscode-theme="light"]`).
  If a token's missing, panel chrome silently falls back to
  unstyled — check the cascade if a control suddenly looks wrong in
  light mode only.
- Fixtures use scripted `actions` (CSS-selector clicks) to drive flows
  the extension normally triggers through user input — entering focus
  mode, toggling a bundle chip, picking a filter option. Reach for the
  `actions` array instead of trying to bake "I'm in focus mode" state
  into the manifest.
- The harness is a design preview, **not** a substitute for
  `test:electron`. Use it for shape, layout, and theming; use the
  electron suite for behavioural correctness (message routing, daemon
  round-trips, focus traversal).
- **WebGL fixtures** (the 3D `spatial-view`): the config's
  `launchOptions` run Chromium with software WebGL
  (`--enable-unsafe-swiftshader --use-gl=angle`), so no GPU is needed.
  three.js loads quad textures through its own image loader (not
  `.preview-card img`), which the rAF/img settle can't observe — give
  those a beat with a `settleMs` field on the fixture (the `spatial-view`
  fixture uses `1600`). Set
  `HARNESS_CHROMIUM=<path-to-chrome>` when the default Playwright
  Chromium download isn't present (some sandboxes ship only the full
  build, not the headless shell).
- **Live XR capture** (`spatial-xr-real`): the committed spatial fixtures wrap
  the `spatial-rich` proxy (per-panel renders assembled offline). To diff the
  _actual_ `composePreviewRenderXr` output, the `render-xr-composite` CI job
  generates a fixture from the real render dir with
  [`fixtures/spatial-xr-real.gen.mjs`](fixtures/spatial-xr-real.gen.mjs)
  (`--render-dir <renders/<id>> --texture-base /spatial-fixtures/spatial-xr-real/`),
  snapshots it (`HARNESS_FIXTURE=spatial-xr-real`), and uploads the PNG as the
  `spatial-xr-real-render` artifact. The fixture + staged textures are generated
  in CI and git-ignored (never committed). The generator's shape is unit-tested
  in `src/test/spatialXrRealGen.test.ts`.

## Run

The harness runs on **`@playwright/test`** (config:
[`playwright.config.mjs`](playwright.config.mjs)). The runner owns the
static server's lifecycle (the `webServer` block boots
[`_server.mjs`](_server.mjs)), parallelises the `(fixture × theme)`
matrix, and retains a trace on failure.

```sh
npm run harness:snapshot         # build the bundle + capture all fixtures
# narrow the matrix (replaces the old --fixture / --theme flags):
HARNESS_FIXTURE=grid-default HARNESS_THEME=dark npm run harness:snapshot
# or use Playwright's own grep:
npx playwright test -c preview-harness/playwright.config.mjs -g grid-default
```

PNGs land in `preview-harness/out/` (gitignored), one
`<fixture>.<theme>.png` per case — same names the CI diff consumes. On a
failure, open the trace with `npx playwright show-trace
preview-harness/test-results/<case>/trace.zip` for a DOM + console +
network snapshot of the run.

To preview interactively, serve the extension root and open
`http://localhost:.../preview-harness/index.html`:

```sh
npx --yes http-server -c-1 .       # from the repo root
```

## The serve harness moved

The `compose-preview serve` specs — the standalone page captures, the daemon-backed render lanes,
the playground end-to-end and the bundle-upload flow — used to live here and now live in
[`preview-server/preview-harness/`](https://github.com/yschimke/compose-ai-tools/blob/main/preview-server/preview-harness/). They were never the
panel's: they drive the server's web surfaces, and having them here made 167 of `harness:snapshot`'s
205 tests somebody else's. See that directory's README, and
[docs/design/PREVIEW_SERVER_SPLIT.md](https://github.com/yschimke/compose-ai-tools/blob/main/docs/design/PREVIEW_SERVER_SPLIT.md) for why.

What that means for this harness:

- `harness:snapshot` now names `snapshot.spec.mjs` rather than filtering on `snapshot`, which used
  to sweep `pages-snapshot.spec.mjs` in too.
- The captures still land in one diff surface: `vscode-preview-comment` merges this directory's
  `out/` with the server harness's before diffing, so a reviewer reads one table.
- **Keep `@playwright/test` here and there in step.** Both harnesses feed the same baseline branch,
  so a version skew moves pixels for reasons no PR explains.

## Wire-side contract

```sh
npm run harness:contract         # assert each fixture's expectedPosts
HARNESS_FIXTURE=a11y-findings npm run harness:contract
```

Same drive as `harness:snapshot` ([`contract.spec.mjs`](contract.spec.mjs)
shares [`_drive.mjs`](_drive.mjs) with [`snapshot.spec.mjs`](snapshot.spec.mjs)),
but instead of writing a PNG it reads
`window.__composePreviewHarness.postedMessageLog` after the fixture's
actions complete and asserts each fixture's optional `expectedPosts` /
`forbiddenPosts` arrays via `expect`. Fixtures with neither array are
skipped. Use it to pin the
end-to-end wire effect of clicking a chip / toggling a kind /
selecting a row, without launching real VS Code: the harness's
`vscode-api.js` shim already captures every `vscode.postMessage`
call, the contract just compares them against the per-fixture rules.

A fixture's `expectedPosts` is an array of subset-match templates —
every key on the template must equal the same key on some recorded
post; extra keys on the recorded post are ignored. Helper:

```js
import { expectSetDataExtension } from "./_utils.mjs";

expectedPosts: [
    expectSetDataExtension(focusId, "compose/semantics", true),
],
```

`forbiddenPosts` is the inverse — fail if any recorded post matches.
Useful for "this code path must NOT subscribe `kind X` until the user
opts in" assertions.

## How it works

1. `scenario.html` is a static page that loads `media/preview.css`,
   `media/codicon.css`, and the harness's `vscode-theme.css` (VS Code's
   CSS custom property defaults for the dark + light themes).
2. `vscode-api.js` installs a stub `acquireVsCodeApi()` so `getVsCodeApi()`
   resolves outside a real webview. Posted messages land in
   `window.__composePreviewHarness.postedMessageLog` for inspection.
3. The page fetches the named fixture, stamps its `dataset.*` onto a
   freshly-created `<preview-app>` element (BEFORE injecting `preview.js`
   so Lit's `firstUpdated` reads the intended boot flags), then injects
   the bundle.
4. After `customElements.whenDefined('preview-app')` and the element's
   first `updateComplete`, the page replays `fixture.messages` via
   `window.postMessage(...)` — the same path the real webview takes for
   `setPreviews` / `updateImage` / etc. — then flips
   `__composePreviewHarness.booted`.
5. **Who drives the `actions` differs by entry point.** Under Playwright
   (the page is opened with `?driver=playwright`), the page _stops_ at
   `booted` and the spec replays `actions` through locators
   (`dispatchEvent("click")`, which auto-waits for the element to attach
   and matches the bundle's real click handlers). Opened any other way —
   the manual `index.html` iframes — `scenario.html` replays the actions
   itself so the static preview still shows the post-action state.
6. The runner's `webServer` boots [`_server.mjs`](_server.mjs) (a tiny
   static server, since `file://` blocks `fetch()` in Chromium).
   [`snapshot.spec.mjs`](snapshot.spec.mjs) waits for `booted`, replays
   actions, then captures a full-page PNG with `animations: "disabled"`
   so CSS animations — including the infinite skeleton shimmer — are
   frozen at capture rather than waited on.

## Adding a fixture

Drop `preview-harness/fixtures/<name>.json` with shape:

```json
{
    "description": "What this scenario shows",
    "dataset": {
        "earlyFeatures": "false",
        "minimalMode": "false"
    },
    "messages": [
        { "command": "setPreviews", "moduleDir": "...", "previews": [...], "heavyStaleIds": [] },
        { "command": "updateImage", "previewId": "...", "captureIndex": 0, "imageData": "<raw base64>" }
    ],
    "actions": [
        { "click": ".preview-card[data-preview-id=\"...\"] .card-focus-btn" },
        { "click": "bundle-chip-bar button[data-bundle=\"a11y\"]" }
    ]
}
```

`messages` are `ExtensionToWebview` payloads (see
`src/types.ts`). `updateImage.imageData` is **raw base64** — the card
prepends `data:<mime>;base64,` itself.

`actions` replay user-style interactions after the manifest has
rendered, using CSS selectors against the panel's light DOM. Use
them to drive flows that the extension would normally trigger through
clicks — e.g. entering focus mode via `.card-focus-btn`, activating a
data extension via the bundle chip bar. Today the only action type is
`{ "click": "<selector>" }`.

For repeatable bytes, write a generator next to the fixture
(`grid-default.gen.mjs` is the template) and check it into git
alongside the JSON it emits.

## Fidelity caveats

This is a design preview, not a substitute for `test:electron`. Drift
sources:

- **Theme tokens** are VS Code's defaults frozen into `vscode-theme.css`.
  Real VS Code installs can swap the colour theme and the panel will
  follow; the harness will not.
- **CSP** is the http server's default (anything goes). The live webview
  enforces a strict policy.
- **Host messaging** is purely scripted. The harness can't exercise
  daemon round-trips or the focus/diff flows that depend on the
  extension replying.

When a new `--vscode-*` token starts appearing in `media/preview.css`,
add a value for it in `vscode-theme.css` (both dark and light blocks).

## What belongs in a capture, and what belongs in a component test

A capture answers **"does this look right"**. A component test
(`cli/serve-web/test/*.test.ts`, mocha + happy-dom) answers **"does this do the
right thing"**. Those are different questions, and a state that drives an
interaction and then asserts on text, counts, attributes or URLs is a component
test wearing a screenshot's clothes — it pays a browser's cost and a baseline's
maintenance for an answer that does not involve pixels.

Measured on this suite:

|                          | count                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `FIXTURE_STATES` entries | 59                                    |
| …carrying any `expect()` | 9                                     |
| …pure captures           | 50                                    |
| `cli/serve-web` tests    | 743 in 51 files (19 element, 32 pure) |

The 50 pure captures are the harness doing its job. The 9 hybrids are worth
reading, because most of what they assert has a cheaper home:

- **URL construction** (`href` contains `mode=spec`, `specView=diff`; a tag
  starting `a|`) — string building, no pixels.
- **Zoom arithmetic** (`zoom === 1`, an identity transform, alignment within
  2px) — `cli/serve-web/src/zoom/viewport.ts` already has its own tests; the
  capture re-asserts them through a browser.
- **Typography grouping** (`.cp-typography-group` count, `.cp-typography-count`
  text, an override reading `wght 700`) — covered by
  `referenceCompareElement.test.ts`. It was NOT, when this section first landed:
  that test checked only that a group existed, and the claim here was wrong
  until the coverage was actually written. Check before you move something.

FOUR `FIXTURE_STATES` entries genuinely need a browser and should stay, covering
three categories of checks:

- `toBeVisible()`, which is a CSS question happy-dom cannot answer;
- the design page's alignment check, which measures real laid-out geometry
  rather than the arithmetic behind it;
- **`zoom-wheel`**, which reads the computed `outlineWidth` and `outlineOffset`
  that `serve.css` produces and verifies the node marks counter-scale with
  `--cp-page-zoom`. `viewport.test.ts` and `pageZoom.test.ts` cover the
  arithmetic and the custom-property assignment, but neither evaluates the
  stylesheet, so this is the only direct check that the marks stay hairlines at
  high zoom instead of becoming slabs over the shape. Its own comment records an
  earlier version that read `border` — always `0` on these nodes — and so
  "passed however wrong the stylesheet was".

### The limit that matters most

**A capture can only cover an input the fixture actually contains**, and each new
fixture costs a baseline. That is not a theoretical concern:

- Every fixture SVG sits at `translate(0, 0)`, so a scorer bug that dropped
  fractional offsets entirely — mis-registering the SVG lane by hundreds of
  pixels, worth ~20 points of score — was invisible to every capture in this
  suite. Fixed in #3979 with a case in `format-compare-scorer.spec.mjs`.
- Every fixture `fontFamily` is single-suffix, so a typography bug that showed
  two families and compared them as one was equally invisible. Fixed in #3981,
  covered by unit tests.

Both shipped, both were found by reading code rather than by ~500 captures. A
decision whose inputs are expensive to vary is under-covered by construction, so
coverage of _decisions_ belongs where inputs are free.

### Cost, for calibration

743 unit tests run in about 2 seconds. One fixture's 10 captures take 8–13.
There are 58 page fixtures.

### Rule of thumb

1. Extract the decision into a DOM-free module and test it there.
2. If it needs the DOM but not pixels, test the element in happy-dom.
3. Keep the capture for what is left: the picture.

The same brittleness exists one layer down. Six Kotlin assertions that grepped
`viewer.js` / `format-compare.js` for the _spelling_ of an expression broke
during the TypeScript migration without any behaviour changing; each was
retargeted at the seam, with the rule itself driven by a real test. A test that
pins source text is a screenshot of code.

## Capture determinism

Two runs of the same tree must produce byte-identical PNGs. Three things enforce
that. The first two were added for issue #3837, after four `serve-*` captures
were found differing between runs of unmodified code; the third for issue #4392:

- **Rasterization** — `playwright.config.mjs` launches Chromium with
  `--disable-partial-raster --disable-skia-runtime-opts`. Without them, cached
  tile reuse and CPU-feature-dependent Skia paths round antialiased rounded
  corners differently from run to run (20–30 px, ±1–3 colour units).
  `serve-design-page-index` was the worst: it latched onto one of two variants
  for a whole process, so it read as a real diff on PRs that touched nothing
  near it. Deliberately NOT `--disable-lcd-text` / `--disable-gpu-rasterization`
  — they fix it too, but change glyph rasterization and move 12–20k pixels on
  every capture.
- **Scroll animation** — the runner installs an init script (`pinScrollsInstant`)
  that forces `behavior: "instant"` on every scroll API taking an options bag,
  before the page's own scripts run. The catalog tree jumps to a clicked row's
  destination with `scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" })`, and that animation
  outlives the `aria-expanded` wait the state ends on: the sticky header and the
  sticky sidebar are then photographed mid-glide, so a full-page capture differs
  run to run by nothing but three integer translations (issue #4392 —
  `serve-landing-tree-depth-component-open` produced four distinct PNGs in five
  runs of identical code). Waiting the animation out does NOT work: a smooth
  scroll is eased, so its opening frames move less than a pixel and a
  "same offset two frames running" test calls it finished before it has begun.
  `settleScroll` still runs at the shutter as a guard for anything that scrolls
  itself on a timer.
- **Pointer position** — a `FIXTURE_STATES` entry can set `parkPointer: true`,
  which moves the mouse to (0, 0) before the shot. `page.click()` leaves the
  pointer where it clicked, so a state that expands something slides fresh rows
  under it and captures a coin-flip hover.

`parkPointer` is **opt-in on purpose.** Parking by default was measured and
moved 53 of 196 captures, because a large minority of these states exist to
capture the resting pointer — `serve-home-index-card-hover`,
`serve-design-page-hover`, `serve-landing-public-card-hover`, both
`serve-landing-live` long-press states. Those keep passing while quietly
capturing the un-hovered page, which is the worst possible failure for a
baseline. Set `parkPointer` only when the pointer position is incidental.

To check determinism after changing the harness, run the suite twice into
separate directories and compare:

```
cd vscode-extension
for i in 1 2; do
  rm -rf preview-harness/out
  npm run harness:snapshot
  cp -r preview-harness/out /tmp/run$i
done
diff -rq /tmp/run1 /tmp/run2   # must be silent
```

The same check for the serve page captures runs from
`preview-server/preview-harness/` with `npm run harness:pages`.
