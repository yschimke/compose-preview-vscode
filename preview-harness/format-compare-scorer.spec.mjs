// Behavioural tests for the `/compare` page's design-reference scorer.
//
// The rest of this harness screenshots pages. This spec instead drives
// `window.ComposePreviewCompare.scoreImageUrls` directly over synthetic images, because the
// property under test is numeric and the interesting cases are ones no committed fixture
// currently contains.
//
// What it pins down: a design reference and a rendered preview are framed differently by
// construction. The preview carries whatever its `@Preview` scaffold added — `showBackground`'s
// opaque sheet, a `padding()` inset, a fixed-height container the content does not fill — and the
// reference is usually cropped to the artboard. The scorer normalises both to their content box so
// the number answers "does this component look like its design?" rather than "were these two
// exported at the same size?".
//
// The images are drawn in-page and passed as data URIs: no fixture files, and a data URI does not
// taint the canvas, so the scorer can sample pixels exactly as it does for a served artifact.
//
// The annotation-correspondence tests that used to live here have moved to
// `cli/serve-web/test/annotateMatch.test.ts` and `annotateTypography.test.ts`. They ran in Chromium
// only because the code was inside an IIFE; it is arithmetic over boxes and needs no browser. What
// is left needs one — it samples real canvas pixels.
